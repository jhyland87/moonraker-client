# moonraker-client
Just a Socket IO client for a Moonraker instance. 
This is somewhat buggy and not very feature rich, as it basically just has the features I needed at the time.


### Note
This is a very simple SocketIO client meant just for Moonraker, written in Javascript.
I do plan on re-doing this in TypeScript, and implementing a class interface that will allow creating classes for other printer management APIs such as OctoPrint. But for now, I just needed something simple for another project I'm working on.
